# Library-Management-System
This GitHub repository hosts a Java-based Library Management System, offering an efficient and comprehensive solution for managing a library's resources. This project leverages object-oriented programming principles, multithreading, functions, and conditional statements to provide an array of essential features. 

Project Description:

This GitHub repository contains a Java-based Library Management System, which is a comprehensive software solution for managing a library's resources, including books, library members, and library staff. The project incorporates object-oriented programming concepts, multithreading, functions, and conditional statements. It offers various features, including adding books, searching for books, borrowing books, returning books, and generating reports.

Key Features:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Implements classes for books, library members, and library staff with appropriate attributes and methods. Utilizes inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to model different types of books and library users.

Multithreading: Implements a concurrent system to allow multiple library users to borrow or return books simultaneously. Utilizes multithreading to handle concurrent requests and ensure thread safety.

Functions: Provides functions to perform various operations, such as adding books to the library, searching for books by title or author, updating book information, handling user registration, borrowing, returning, and generating reports.

Conditional Statements: Utilizes conditional statements for handling different scenarios, such as checking book availability before borrowing, verifying user credentials during login, and applying fine calculations for late returns.

How to Use:
